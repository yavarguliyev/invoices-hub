# üèó Architecture Overview

#### This Node.js application follows a monolithic architecture that is modular and scalable. It uses the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure that the codebase is well-organized and follows the business domain logic.

* Monolithic: While designed as a monolithic application, it‚Äôs built with an architecture that supports easy splitting into microservices should the need arise.
* Modular: The application is divided into clear modules like orders, users, invoices, etc., each with its own responsibility. This makes it easy to extend the system with new features.
* Layered Architecture: It follows a typical layered architecture pattern, separating concerns into layers such as the API layer (controllers), service layer, data access layer (repositories), and domain layer (models).
* Asynchronous Processing: Worker threads and Redis are used for asynchronous processing, ensuring that long-running tasks (like email notifications) don‚Äôt block the main application flow.
* Event-Driven: The application utilizes RabbitMQ to handle domain events (e.g., order updates, user creation) asynchronously, enabling decoupled communication between components.

---

# üß©üîÑ‚öôÔ∏èüåê Interaction Flow in DDD and Architecture

## 1. Domain Layer:

* The core domain logic is housed here, where entities like Order, User, and Invoice live. They represent the key concepts in the business domain.
* Operations like changing an order status or creating a user are encapsulated within these entities.

## 2. Application Layer:

* Services such as OrderService and UserService interact with domain entities to perform operations. They use repositories for data persistence.
* This layer uses patterns like Command and Observer to handle business logic and notify the system of changes (e.g., notifying the admins when an order is created).

## 3. Infrastructure Layer:

* Handles the technical details such as PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and email notifications.
* Redis is used to cache frequently accessed data, reducing load on the database.
* Worker threads handle tasks asynchronously, such as background processing for email notifications or batch updates.

## 4. API Layer:

* Exposes REST API endpoints to clients, interacting with the application layer to perform the required business logic.
* Uses ExpressJS and Swagger for routing and API documentation.

## 5. Event-Driven Communication:

* When a significant change occurs (like order approval or user creation), events are published to RabbitMQ to inform other systems or services.

# üß©‚öôÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏èüìê Design Patterns

##### The following design patterns have been applied to the system to ensure modularity, flexibility, and scalability:

## 1. Singleton Pattern

* Used for: Managing the database connection and the Redis cache manager.
* Why: Ensures that only one instance of the database connection or Redis client is created throughout the application, reducing the overhead and promoting reuse.

## 2. Factory Pattern

* Used for: Creating various service instances based on the application‚Äôs configuration.
* Why: Simplifies object creation and reduces tight coupling between components. Used for creating different database service objects or models.

## 3. Dependency Injection (DI)

* Used for: Injecting dependencies like services, repositories, and controllers into other components, e.g., through the TypeDI library.
* Why: Decouples the components and ensures that each class only knows about the abstractions, not the specific implementations. This makes testing and maintaining the codebase easier.

## 4. Observer Pattern

* Used for: Managing state changes and broadcasting changes to subscribers. This is used in parts of the application that require real-time updates, such as pushing notifications or WebSocket-based messages.
* Why: Provides an efficient way to notify parts of the application that need to act based on state changes.

## 5. Strategy Pattern

* Used for: Implementing different querying strategies (e.g., different REST API response structures).
* Why: Allows switching between different query response strategies without changing the core logic of the application.

## 6. Command Pattern

* Used for: Handling complex workflows or commands like submitting a job to Redis or performing CRUD operations in a transactional manner.
* Why: Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing parameterization and decoupling of command execution from the client.

## 7. Decorator Pattern

* Used for: Enhancing the functionality of services and controllers dynamically.
* Why: Allows adding new behavior (e.g., logging, error handling) without modifying existing code, promoting a clean and extendable design.

## 8. Proxy Pattern

* Used for: Implementing caching and rate-limiting mechanisms in front of certain APIs.
* Why: Helps optimize system performance by controlling access to external services, ensuring that expensive operations are cached or rate-limited.

## 9. Repository Pattern

* Used for: Abstracting the data access layer to provide a more manageable and flexible way to interact with the database.
* Why: Helps decouple database logic from business logic, making it easier to change or optimize data access strategies without impacting the rest of the application.

## 10. Builder Pattern

* Used for: Constructing complex objects like invoices, user profiles, and report generation in a systematic way.
* Why: Provides a flexible solution for constructing complex objects step by step, avoiding constructor overloading or complex factory methods.

## 11. Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

* Used for: Domain events trigger integration events that are published to RabbitMQ.
* Why: Enables asynchronous communication between components through event publishing and handling.

# üìèüß≠üí°‚öñÔ∏è Principles

##### This project follows key software design principles to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase:

## 1. SOLID Principles

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class and module has a single responsibility, minimizing changes and complexity.
* Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes and modules are open for extension but closed for modification, enabling easier feature additions without breaking existing functionality.
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes can be used in place of their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This helps in creating smaller, specialized interfaces.
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, which is achieved through DI.

## 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

* The codebase ensures that redundant logic and code are minimized. Reusable components and functions are created for common tasks such as error handling, logging, and validation.

## 3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

* The application follows a simple and clear architecture, avoiding unnecessary complexity in both the design and implementation. We favor simplicity and readability.

## 4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

* Only essential features and functionality are implemented. The project avoids overengineering, focusing on the current requirements.

## 5. Separation of Concerns

* The project ensures that business logic, data access, and presentation are separated. Each module is responsible for a specific concern, promoting modularity and maintainability.

## 6. Composition Over Inheritance

* The project favors composing objects and reusing behavior through composition rather than relying heavily on inheritance.
